# <a id="macroeconomics"></a>Macroeconomics
Macroeconomics refers to the study of the entire economy in terms of the total amount of goods and services produced, total income earned, the level of employment of productive resources, and the general behavior of prices.

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that focuses on the behavior and decision-making of an economy as a whole. In this manner it differs from the field of microeconomics, which evaluates the motivations of and relationships between individual economic agents.


- Macroeconomists study aggregated indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, and price indices to understand how the whole economy functions.
- Macroeconomists develop models that explain the relationship between such factors as national income, output, consumption, unemployment, inflation, savings, investment, government spending and international trade.
- Though macroeconomics encompasses a variety of concepts and variables, but there are three central topics for macroeconomic research on the national level: output, unemployment, and inflation.

# <a id="gdp"></a>GDP - Gross Domestic Product
Gross domestic product is the market value of all final goods and services produced within the national borders of a country for a given period of time.

    - “Gross” implies that no deduction for the reduction in the stock of plant and    equipment due to wear and tear has been applied to the measurements and survey-based estimates. 
    - “Domestic” means that the GDP includes only production by factors located in the country–whether home or foreign owned. GDP includes the production and income of foreigners and foreign-owned property in the home country and excludes the production and incomes of the country’s own citizens or their property located abroad. 
    - “Product” refers to the measurement of output at final prices as observed in market transactions or of the market value of factors (inclusive of taxes less subsidies) used in their creation. Only newly produced goods–including those that increase inventories–are counted in GDP.

Since GDP measures income and output, it can be used to compare two countries. The country with higher GDP is often regarded as wealthier, but, when using GDP to compare countries, it is important to remember to adjust for population.

How to measure it
- **Income Approach**

The income approach equates the total output of a nation to the total factor income received by residents or citizens of the nation.

    The main types of factor income are:
    - Employee compensation (cost of fringe benefits, including unemployment, health, and retirement benefits);
    - Interest received net of interest paid;
    - Rental income (mainly for the use of real estate) net of expenses of landlords;
    - Royalties paid for the use of intellectual property and extractable natural resources.

- **Expenditure Approach**

The expenditure approach is basically an output accounting method. It focuses on finding the total output of a nation by finding the total amount of money spent.
The expenditure approach attempts to calculate GDP by evaluating the sum of all final good and services purchased in an economy. The components of U.S. GDP identified as “Y” in equation form, include Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Spending (G) and Net Exports (X – M).
Y = C + I + G + (X − M) is the standard equational (expenditure) representation of GDP.

    - “C” (consumption) is normally the largest GDP component in the economy, consisting of private expenditures (household final consumption expenditure) in the economy. Personal expenditures fall under one of the following categories: durable goods, non-durable goods, and services.
    - “I” (investment) includes, for instance, business investment in equipment, but does not include exchanges of existing assets. Spending by households (not government) on new houses is also included in Investment. “Investment” in GDP does not mean purchases of financial products. It is important to note that buying financial products is classed as ‘ saving,’ as opposed to investment.
    - “G” ( government spending ) is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchase of weapons for the military, and any investment expenditure by a government. However, since GDP is a measure of productivity, transfer payments made by the government are not counted because these payment do not reflect a purchase by the government, rather a movement of income. They are captured in “C” when the payments are spent.
    - “X” (exports) represents gross exports. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for other nations’ consumption, therefore exports are added.
    - “M” (imports) represents gross imports. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms “G”, “I”, or “C”, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic.

- **Output Approach**

The output approach focuses on finding the total output of a nation by directly finding the total value of all goods and services a nation produces.
Because of the complication of the multiple stages in the production of a good or service, only the final value of a good or service is included in the total output. This avoids an issue referred to as double counting, where the total value of a good is included several times in national output, by counting it repeatedly in several stages of production.

# <a id="cost-of-living"></a>Cost of Living
The cost of living is the amount of money needed to cover basic expenses such as housing, food, taxes, and healthcare in a certain place and time period. The cost of living is often used to compare how expensive it is to live in one city versus another. The cost of living is tied to wages. If expenses are higher in a city, such as New York, for example, salary levels must be higher so that people can afford to live in that city. 

**Cost of Living Index**

The cost of living index compares the cost of living in a major city to a corresponding metropolitan area. The index incorporates the expense of various living expenses creating an aggregate measure that workforce entrants can use as a benchmark.

Although there are various types of cost of living indexes that use different variables and metrics, most set a base cost of living, often represented by 100. 

## CPI - Consumer Price Index
The consumer price index (CPI) is a statistical estimate of the change in prices of goods and services bought for consumption.
The CPI is calculated by collecting the prices of a sample of representative items over a specific period of time.
The CPI can be used to index the real value of wages, salaries, pensions, and price regulation. It is one of the most closely watched national economic statistics.

**CPI limitations**

The CPI is a convenient way to calculate the cost of living and price level for a certain period of time. However, the CPI does not provide a completely accurate estimate for the cost of living. Issues that impede the accuracy of the CPI include substitution bias (consumers substituting goods for others), introducing new products, and changes in quality. The CPI can also overstate inflation because it does not always account for quality improvements or new goods and services.

# <a id="other-measures"></a>Other Measures
All of the measures are especially concerned with counting the total amount of goods and services produced within some boundary. The boundary is usually defined by geography or citizenship, and may also restrict the goods and services that are counted. For instance, some measures count only goods and services that are exchanged for money, excluding bartered goods, while other measures may attempt to include bartered goods by imputing monetary values to them.

## Real and Nominal GDP
Real GDP growth is the value of all goods produced in a given year; nominal GDP is value of all the goods taking price changes into account.

**Real GDP**:
The real GDP is the total value of all of the final goods and services that an economy produces during a given year, accounting for inflation. It is calculated using the prices of a selected base year. To calculate Real GDP, you must determine how much GDP has been changed by inflation since the base year, and divide out the inflation each year.

**Nominal GDP**:
The nominal GDP is the value of all the final goods and services that an economy produced during a given year. It is calculated by using the prices that are current in the year in which the output is produced. In economics, a nominal value is expressed in monetary terms.

## GDP Deflator
The GDP deflator is a price index that measures inflation or deflation in an economy by calculating a ratio of nominal GDP to real GDP.

= [(nominal GDP)/(real GDP)] x100

## GNP - Gross National Product
Gross national product (GNP) is an estimate of total value of all the final products and services turned out in a given period by the means of production owned by a country's residents. 

GNP is commonly calculated by taking the sum of personal consumption expenditures, private domestic investment, government expenditure, net exports and any income earned by residents from overseas investments, minus income earned within the domestic economy by foreign residents.

**GDP VS GNP**
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of a nation's finished domestic goods and services during a specific time period. A related but different metric, the gross national product (GNP), is the value of all finished goods and services owned by a country's residents over a period of time. 

While GDP limits its interpretation of the economy to the geographical borders of the country, GNP extends it to include the net overseas economic activities performed by its nationals.

## GNI - Gross National Income
GNI is the total amount of money earned by a nation's people and businesses. It is used to measure and track a nation's wealth from year to year. The number includes the nation's gross domestic product plus the income it receives from overseas sources.

## NNI - Net National Income
Net national income (NNI) is defined as gross national income minus the depreciation of fixed capital assets through wear and tear and obsolescence.

## GDP per capita
Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is the mean income of people in an economic unit.

GDP per capita is calculated by dividing GDP by the total population of the country.

## Personal Income
Personal income is an individual’s total earnings from wages, investment interest, and other sources.

## Disposable Income
Disposable income is the income left after paying taxes.

Disposable personal income = Personal income – Personal current taxes

# <a id="production-and-growth"></a>Production and Growth

## Economic Growth
Economic growth is measured as the increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the long-run, through higher resources or productivity.

## Productivity
Increasing productivity is a rare win-win, improving the standard of living from a governmental, commercial and consumer perspective.

Productivity is essentially the efficiency in which a company or economy can transform resources into goods, potentially creating more from less.

Productivity can effectively raise living standards through decreasing the required monetary investment in everyday necessities (and luxuries), making consumers wealthier and business more profitable and in turn enabling higher government tax revenues.

Economists looking to measure this productivity within a given system generally leverage production functions to determine how different factors of production (i.e. inputs ) affect the overall output.

The final important consideration in assessing productivity potential is the production-possibility frontier (PPF), which outlines the maximum production quantity of two goods in the scope of our current technological capacity and supply.

## Technology
Technological advances play a crucial role in improving productivity, and thus the standard of living in a system.

Measuring the affects of technology on productivity is a difficult pursuit. It is generally approached through metrics such as Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ), GDP per capita, and Total Factor Productivity (TFP).

In economics, technological change is a term used to describe the change in a set of feasible production possibilities.

## Human Capital
Human capital refers to the accumulated skills and talents that a person learns in order to increase his or her success in life.

# <a id="long-run-growth"></a>Long-Run Growth
Long-run growth is defined as the sustained rise in the quantity of goods and services that an economy produces.

Determinants of long-run growth include growth of productivity, demographic changes, and labor force participation.

    - Growth of productivity: is the ratio of economic outputs to inputs ( capital, labor, energy, materials, and services). When the productivity increases the cost of goods is lowered. Lower prices increase the demand for the product or service. An increase in demand can lead to higher revenue.
    - Demographic changes: demographic factors influence economic growth by changing the employment to population ratio. Factors include the quantity and quality of available natural resources. Age structure of the population also influences employment and long-run growth.
    - Labor force participation: the amount of labor force participation and the size of economic sectors influence economic growth. The labor force participation is the amount of workers available. In countries with high development and industrialization, labor force participation is high because of low birth and death rates.

When the economic growth matches the growth of money supply, an economy will continue to grow and thrive.

When the GDP growth is only caused by increases in population, the growth is excessive.

**Pros and Cons**

Arguments in support of economic growth include increased productivity, the expansion of power, and an increase in the quality of life.
Arguments opposed to economic growth include resource depletion, environmental impacts, and equitable growth.

# <a id="saving-and-investment"></a>Saving and Investment
- Saving is setting aside money you don’t spend now for emergencies or for a future purchase. It’s money you want to be able to access quickly, with little or no risk, and with the least amount of taxes. Financial institutions offer a number of different savings options.
- Investing is buying assets such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds or real estate with the expectation that your investment will make money for you. Investments usually are selected to achieve long-term goals. Generally speaking, investments can be categorized as income investments or growth investments.

## Saving
 Savings refers to the money that a person has left over after they subtract out their consumer spending from their disposable income over a given time period. Savings, therefore, represents a net surplus of funds for an individual or household after all expenses and obligations have been paid.

Savings are kept in the form of cash or cash equivalents (e.g. as bank deposits), which are exposed to no risk of loss but also come with correspondingly minimal returns. Savings can be grown through investing, which requires that the money be put at risk, however.

## Investment

**???**

### Interest
Interest is the cost of borrowing money, where the borrower pays a fee to the lender for the loan. The interest, typically expressed as a percentage, can be either simple or compounded.

**Simple Interest**

Simple interest is based on the principal amount of a loan or deposit.
Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount of a loan or deposit, so it is easier to determine than compound interest.

Generally, simple interest paid or received over a certain period is a fixed percentage of the principal amount that was borrowed or lent. 

**Compound Interest**

In contrast, compound interest is based on the principal amount and the interest that accumulates on it in every period. 

Compound interest accrues and is added to the accumulated interest of previous periods; it includes interest on interest, in other words. 

### Risk-Return Tradeoff
The risk-return tradeoff states that the potential return rises with an increase in risk. Using this principle, individuals associate low levels of uncertainty with low potential returns, and high levels of uncertainty or risk with high potential returns. According to the risk-return tradeoff, invested money can render higher profits only if the investor will accept a higher possibility of losses.

### Financial Markets
Financial markets refer broadly to any marketplace where the trading of securities occurs, including the stock market, bond market, forex market, and derivatives market, among others. Financial markets are vital to the smooth operation of capitalist economies. 

### Insurance
An insurance policy is a contract in which the policyholder receives financial reparations or protection from an adverse event that's covered under the policy. In return for this protection, the policyholder pays the insurance company in the form of premiums. 

There are various types of insurance policies that protect policyholders or those named in the policy from financial harm or liability, which is the risk of being sued. 

A typical insurance policy is usually a primary insurance policy, which covers the financial cost of an insurance claim up to a certain limit.
Excess insurance covers specific amounts beyond the limits in the primary policy. Reinsurance is when insurers pass a portion of their policies onto other insurers to reduce the financial cost in the event a claim is paid out. 

### Money Management
Money management refers to the processes of budgeting, saving, investing, spending, or otherwise overseeing the capital usage of an individual or group. The term can also refer more narrowly to investment management and portfolio management. 

### Budgeting
A budget is an estimation of revenue and expenses over a specified future period of time and is usually compiled and re-evaluated on a periodic basis. Budgets can be made for a person, a group of people, a business, a government, or just about anything else that makes and spends money. 

# <a id="employment-and-unemployment"></a>Employment and Unemployment
Unemployment, also referred to as joblessness, occurs when people are without work and are actively seeking employment. 

Unemployment is calculated as a percentage by dividing the number of unemployed individuals by the number of all the individuals currently employed in the work force.

**Types of Unemployment**

Types of unemployment determine what the causes, consequences, and solutions. The types of unemployment include: classical, cyclical, structural, frictional, hidden, and long-term.

    - Classical: occurs when real wages for jobs are set above the market-clearing level. It causes the number of job seekers to be higher than the number of vacancies.
    - Cyclical: occurs when there is not enough aggregate demand in the economy to provide jobs for everyone who wants to work. Demand for goods and services decreases, less production is needed, and fewer workers are needed.
    - Structural: occurs when the labor market is not able to provide jobs for everyone who wants to work. There is a mismatch between the skills of the unemployed workers and the skills needed for available jobs. It differs from frictional unemployment because it lasts longer.
    - Frictional: the time period in between jobs when a worker is searching for work or transitioning from one job to another.
    - Hidden: the unemployment of potential workers that is not taken into account in official unemployment statistics because of how the data is collected. For example, workers are only considered unemployed if they are looking for work so those without jobs who have stopped looking are no longer considered unemployed.
    - Long-term: usually defined as unemployment lasting longer than one year.

When unemployment rates are high and steady, there are negative impacts on the long-run economic growth.

Demand side and supply side solutions are used to reduce unemployment rates.

    - Demand side solutions: many countries aid unemployed workers through social welfare programs. Individuals receive unemployment benefits including insurance, compensation, welfare, and subsidies to aid in retraining. An example of a demand side solution is government funded employment of the able-bodied poor.
    - Supply side solutions: the labor market is not 100% efficient. Supply side solutions remove the minimum wage and reduce the power of unions. The policies are designed to make the market more flexible in an attempt to increase long-run economic growth. Examples of supply side solutions include cutting taxes on businesses, reducing regulation, and increasing education.

### Full Employment
Full employment is defined as an acceptable level of unemployment somewhere above 0%; there is no cyclical or deficient-demand unemployment.

Full employment represents a range of possible unemployment rates based on the country, time period, and political biases.

Full employment is often seen as an “ideal” unemployment rate. Ideal unemployment excludes types of unemployment where labor-market inefficiency is reflected.

The full employment unemployment rate is also referred to as “natural” unemployment.

### Union
A union is a formal organization of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, achieving higher pay, increasing the number of employees an employer hires, and better working conditions. They function by negotiating with employers to create a collective agreement that applies to all union members and typically lasts for a set time period.

### Efficient Wage Theory
Efficiency wage theory is the idea that firms may permanently hold to a real wage greater than the equilibrium wage.

The consequence of the efficiency wage theory is that the market for labor does may not clear, even in the long run, and unemployment may be persistenly higher than its natural rate.

### Jobs Creation and Destruction
At a macroeconomic level, jobs are created when the general level of output rises and jobs are destroyed when the general level of output falls.

### Inflation and Unemployment
The relationship between inflation rates and unemployment rates is inverse.

- The Philips Curve

The Phillips curve shows the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment: as unemployment decreases, inflation increases.

The long-run Phillips curve is a vertical line at the natural rate of unemployment, so inflation and unemployment are unrelated in the long run.
The short-run Phillips curve depicts the inverse trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

# <a id="inflation"></a>Inflation
Inflation is a persistent increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. Specifically, the rate of inflation is the percent increase of prices from the start to the end of the given time period (usually measured annually).

When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services. Consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within the economy.

The decrease in purchasing power means that inflation is good for debtors and bad for creditors.

**Causes:** most economists agree that in the long run, inflation depends on the money supply. Specifically, the money supply has a direct, proportional relationship with the price level, so if, for example, the currency in circulation increased, there would be a proportional increase in the price of goods.

Historically, inflation has happened only when the money supply has increased faster than the underlying supply of goods and services for an ongoing period of time.

**How to measure it**

Economists typically measure the price level with a price index.
A price index is a number whose movement reflects movement in the average level of prices. If a price index rises 10%, it means the average level of prices has risen 10%.
The price index is the proportion of the cost of a basket of goods in one period to the cost of the same basket of goods in a previous base period.


    - Market basket: A list of items used specifically to track the progress of inflation in an economy or specific market.
    - Purchasing power: The amount of goods and services that can be bought with a unit of currency or by consumers.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) are commonly used inflation indices. The CPI reflects changes in the prices of goods and services typically purchased by consumers.
The PPI reflects changes in the revenue that producers receive for goods and services.

    - Menu costs: The cost to a firm resulting from changing its prices.
    - Shoeleather costs: The cost of time and effort that people spend trying to counter-act the effects of inflation.
    
Hyperinflation

Inflation rates that get out of control to the point they are in the hundreds or thousands of percentage increases every month.

Hyperinflation is very high inflation. Although the threshold is arbitrary, economists generally reserve the term hyperinflation to describe episodes where the monthly inflation rate is greater than 50 percent.

Unexpectedly high inflation tends to transfer wealth from creditors to debtors and from the rich to the poor.


    - Nominal interest rate: The rate of interest before adjustment for inflation.
    - Real interest rate: The rate of interest an investor expects to receive after allowing for inflation.


## Deflation
Deflation is a decrease in the general price levels of goods and services.

When deflation occurs, the general price level is falling and the purchasing power of money is increasing.
    
While there are problems associated with high inflation, economists generally believe that deflation is a more serious problem because it increases the real value of debt and may worsen recessions.

Deflation discourages consumption because consumers know that if they wait to make a purchase, the price will likely drop.

Deflation discourages borrowing and investment because the real value of the money to be repaid will be higher than the real value of the money borrowed.

Some economists believe that deflation is caused by a fall in the general level of demand, while others attribute it to a fall in the money supply.

# <a id="aggregate-demand-and-supply"></a>Aggregate Demand and Supply
**Aggregate Expenditure**

Aggregate expenditure is the current value of all the finished goods and services in the economy.

The aggregate expenditure determines the total amount that firms and households plan to spend on goods and services at each level of income.

The aggregate expenditure is one of the methods that is used to calculate the total sum of all the economic activities in an economy, also known as the gross domestic product (GDP).

The equation for aggregate expenditure is: AE = C + I + G + NX.

    - Consumption (C): The household consumption over a period of time.
    - Investment (I): The amount of expenditure towards the capital goods.
    - Government expenditure (G): The amount of spending by federal, state, and local governments. Government expenditure can include infrastructure or transfers which increase the total expenditure in the economy.
    - Net exports (NX): Total exports minus the total imports.

An economy is said to be at equilibrium when aggregate expenditure is equal to the aggregate supply (production) in the economy.

## Aggregate Demand
Aggregate demand (AD) is the total demand for final goods and services in the economy at a given time and price level.

Simply put, AD is the sum of all demand in an economy. It is often called the effective demand or aggregate expenditure (AE), and is the demand of all gross domestic product (GDP).

Demand Sources

    - Consumption (C): This is the simplest and largest component of aggregate demand (usually 40-60% of all demand), and is often what is intuitively thought of as demand. Consumption is just the amount of consumer spending executed in an economy. Taxes play a role in this exchange as well (i.e. sales tax).
    - Investment (I): Investment is a relatively large portion of demand as well, and is referred to as Gross Domestic Fixed Capital Formation. This is the money spent by firms on capital investment (new machinery, factories, stocks, etc.). Investment equates to about 10% of GDP in most economies.
    - Government Spending (G): This is referred to as General Government Final Consumption, and is the expenditure by the government. This can include welfare, social services, education, military, etc. Fiscal policy is the way in which governments can alter this spending to drive economic change.
    - Net Export (NX): This can be put simply as the sale of goods to foreign countries subtracted by the purchase of goods from other countries (X-M). Trade surpluses and deficits can occur based on whether or not exports or imports are higher.

In summary, the calculation of aggregate demand can be represented as follows: AD = C + I + G + (X-M).

The AD curve is downward sloping.

## Aggregate Supply
Aggregate supply (AS) is the total supply of goods and services that firms in an economy plan on selling during a specific time period.

In the short-run, the aggregate supply is graphed as an upward sloping curve.

The short-run aggregate supply equation is: Y = Y* + α(P-Pe). In the equation, Y is the production of the economy, Y* is the natural level of production of the economy, the coefficient α is always greater than 0, P is the price level, and Pe is the expected price level from consumers.

In the long-run, the aggregate supply is graphed vertically on the supply curve.

The equation used to determine the long-run aggregate supply is: Y = Y*. In the equation, Y is the production of the economy and Y* is the natural level of production of the economy.

In the short-run, the price level of the economy is sticky or fixed; in the long-run, the price level for the economy is completely flexible.

## Macroeconomic equilibrium
In economics, the macroeconomic equilibrium is a state where aggregate supply equals aggregate demand.

In economics, equilibrium is a state where economic forces (supply and demand) are balanced. Without any external influences, price and quantity will remain at the equilibrium value.

Determining the supply and demand for a good or services provides a model of price determination in a market. In a competitive market, the unit price for a good will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. The result is the economic equilibrium for that good or service.

There are four basic laws of supply and demand. The laws impact both supply and demand in the long-run.

    - If quantity demand increases and supply remains unchanged, a shortage occurs, leading to a higher price until the quantity demanded is pushed back to equilibrium.
    - If quantity demand decreases and supply remains unchanged, a surplus occurs, leading to a lower price until the quantity demanded is pushed back to equilibrium.
    - If quantity demand remains unchanged and supply increases, a surplus occurs, leading to a lower price until the quantity supplied is pushed back to equilibrium.
    - If quantity demand remains unchanged and supply decreases, a shortage occurs, leading to a higher price until the quantity supplied is pushed back to equilibrium.

# <a id="money-and-banking-system"></a>Money and Banking System
## Money
Money is any object that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and the repayment of debt.

Money comes in three forms: commodity money, fiat money, and fiduciary money. Most modern monetary systems are based on fiat money.

- Commodity money: derives its value from the commodity of which it is made, while fiat money has value only by the order of the government.
- Fiat money: Money that is given value because those who use it believe it has value; the value is not derived from any inherent characteristic.
- Fiduciary money: includes demand deposits (such as checking accounts) of banks. Fiduciary money is accepted on the basis of the trust its issuer (the bank) commands.

Money functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, and a store of value.

    - Medium of Exchange: When money is used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services, it is performing a function as a medium of exchange.
    - Unit of Account: It is a standard numerical unit of measurement of market value of goods, services, and other transactions. It is a standard of relative worth and deferred payment, and as such is a necessary prerequisite for the formulation of commercial agreements that involve debt. To function as a unit of account, money must be divisible into smaller units without loss of value, fungible (one unit or piece must be perceived as equivalent to any other), and a specific weight or size to be verifiably countable.
    - Store of Value: To act as a store of value, money must be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved. It must be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. Additionally, the value of money must remain stable over time.

The monetary economy is a significant improvement over the barter system, in which goods were exchanged directly for other goods.

    - The barter system has a number of limitations, including the double coincidence of wants, the absence of a common measure of value, indivisibility of certain goods, difficulty of deferred payments, and difficulty of storing wealth.
    - Despite the numerous limitations, the barter system works well when currency is unstable or unavailable for conducting commerce.
    
Money has several defining characteristics
- Durable
- Divisible
- Portable
- Liquid
- A unit of account
- Legal tender
- Resistant to counterfeiting

**Measuring the Money Supply**

The Federal Reserve measures the money supply using three monetary aggregates: M1, M2, and M3.
    
    - M1 is the narrowest measure of the money supply, including only money that can be spent directly.
    - M2 is a broader measure, encompassing M1 and near monies.
    - M3 includes M2 plus relatively less liquid near monies. However, this measure is no longer used in practice.

Other measures

M0 is a measure of all the physical currency and coinage in circulation in an economy.

MB is a measure that captures all physical currency, coinage, and Federal Reserve deposits (special deposits that only banks can have at the Fed).

MZM: “Money Zero Maturity” is one of the most popular aggregates in use by the Fed because its velocity has historically been the most accurate predictor of inflation. It is M2 – time deposits + money market funds.

**The Demand for Money**

In economics, the demand for money is the desired holding of financial assets in the form of money (cash or bank deposits).

- Money supply: The total amount of money (bills, coins, loans, credit, and other liquid instruments) in a particular economy.
- Asset: Something or someone of any value; any portion of one’s property or effects so considered.

## Monetary Policy
Monetary policy is the process by which a monetary authority controls the money supply, often to produce stable prices and low unemployment.

Monetary policy is referred to as either being expansionary or contractionary, where an expansionary policy increases the money supply more rapidly than usual, and contractionary policy expands the money supply more slowly than usual.

    - Expansionary policy is traditionally used to try to combat unemployment by lowering interest rates. A monetary authority will typically pursue expansionary monetary policy when there is an output gap.
    - Contractionary policy is intended to slow inflation in order to avoid the resulting distortions and deterioration of asset values.
    
**Monetary Policy Tools**

- The Reserve Ratio: The reserve ratio is the percentage of deposits that a bank is required to hold in reserves, or funds that are not allowed to be loaned.
- Loanable funds: Money available to be issued as debt.
- The Discount Rate: The rate that member banks charge each other is the federal funds rate and the rate the Fed charges is referred to as the discount rate.
- The Federal Funds Rate: The interest rate at which depository institutions actively trade balances held at the Federal Reserve.
- Open market operations (OMOs): the purchase and sale of securities in the open market by a central bank.
- Taylor Rule: A way of determining the appropriate change in interest rates for a given change in inflation.

## The Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve was created to promote financial stability, provide regulation and banking services, and conduct monetary policy.

The Federal Reserve (the Fed) was originally created in response to a series of bank panics. While its policy goals were originally unclear, today the Fed has a dual mandate: to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.

The Fed has three main policy tools: setting reserve requirements, operating the discount window and other credit facilities, and conducting open-market operations.

- Central bank: The principal monetary authority of a country or monetary union; it normally regulates the supply of money, issues currency and controls interest rates.

- Reserve requirement: The minimum amount of deposits each commercial bank must hold (rather than lend out).

## Banks
The main way that banks earn profits is through issuing loans. Because their depositors do not typically all ask for the entire amount of their deposits back at the same time, banks lend out most of the deposits they have collected.

The fraction of deposits that a bank keeps in cash or as a deposit with the central bank, rather than loaning out to the public, is called the reserve ratio.

A minimum reserve ratio (or reserve requirement ) is mandated by the Fed in order to ensure that banks are able to meet their obligations.

Because banks are only required to keep a fraction of their deposits in reserve and may loan out the rest, banks are able to create money.

A lower reserve requirement allows banks to issue more loans and increase the money supply, while a higher reserve requirement does the opposite.

Money Multiplier

The money multiplier measures the maximum amount of commercial bank money that can be created by a given unit of central bank money.

Commercial bank

A type of financial institution that provides services such as accepting deposits, making business loans, and offering basic investment products to the public.

# <a id="short-term-economic-fluctuations"></a>Short-Term Economic Fluctuations
In the short run, output fluctuates with shifts in either aggregate supply or aggregate demand; in the long run, only aggregate supply affects output.

In the short run, output is determined by both the aggregate supply and aggregate demand within an economy. Anything that causes labor, capital, or efficiency to go up or down results in fluctuations in economic output.

Supply and demand may fluctuate for a number of reasons, and this in turn may affect the level of output. There are noticeable differences between short-run and long-run fluctuations in output.

Over the short-run, an outward shift in the aggregate supply curve would result in increased output and lower prices. An outward shift in the aggregate demand curve would also increase output and raise prices. Short-run nominal fluctuations result in a change in the output level. In the short-run an increase in money will increase production due to a shift in the aggregate supply. More goods are produced because the output is increased and more goods are bought because of the lower prices.

In the long-run, the aggregate supply curve and aggregate demand curve are only affected by capital, labor, and technology. Everything in the economy is assumed to be optimal. The aggregate supply curve is vertical which reflects economists’ belief that changes in aggregate demand only temporarily change the economy’s total output. In the long-run an increase in money will do nothing for output, but it will increase prices.

# <a id="major-theories-in-macroeconomics"></a>Major Theories in Macroeconomics

**Keynesian Theory**

Keynesian theory posits that aggregate demand will not always meet the supply produced.

While Keynesian Theory has been expounded upon significantly over the years, the important takeaway here is that aggregate demand (and thus the amount of supply consumed) is not a perfect system. Instead, demand is affected by various external forces that can create an inefficient market which will in turn affect employment, production, and inflation.

**Monetarist**

Monetarism focuses on the macroeconomic effects of the supply of money and the role of central banking on an economic system.

**Austrian**

Austrian economic thought is about methodological individualism, or the idea that people will act in meaningful ways which can be analyzed.

**Alternative Views**

Neoclassical and neo-Keynesian ideas can be coupled and referred to as the neoclassical synthesis, combining alternative views in economics.

The neoclassical perspective in conjunction with Keynesian ideas is referred to as the neoclassical synthesis, which is largely considered the ‘mainstream’ economic perspective.

A critical difference between classical and neoclassical perspectives is the introduction of marginalism. Marginalism notes that economic participants make decisions based on marginal utility or margins.

Neo-Keynesian economics is the formalization and coordination of Keynes’s writings by a number of other economists (most notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani and Paul Samuelson).

# <a id="financial-system"></a>Financial System
A financial intermediary is an institution that facilitates the flow of funds between individuals or other economic entities.
Banks are a classic example of financial institutions.

**Tools of Finance**
- Time value of money: the principle that a certain amount of money today has a different buying power (value) than in the future.
- Present value: the value of an asset in today’s dollars after adjusting for an increase in the asset values as a result of interest earned during the period.
- Risk premium: the minimum amount of money by which the expected return on a risky asset must exceed the known return on a risk-free asset.
- Time horizon: a fixed point of time in the future where certain processes will be evaluated or assumed to end.
- Systematic risk: the risk associated with an asset that is correlated with the risk of asset markets generally, often measured as its beta.
- Non-systematic risk: risk that is unique to a specific company; can be reduced through diversification.
- Capital asset pricing model: used to determine the required rate of return of an asset taking into account an asset’s sensitivity to non-diversifiable risk (also known as systematic risk or market risk).
- Security market line: a line representing the relationship between expected return and systematic risk; thus a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model.

## Fiscal Policy
Fiscal policy is the use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy.

The government has two levers when setting fiscal policy: it can change the levels of taxation and/or it can change its level of spending.

There are three types of fiscal policy: neutral policy, expansionary policy,and contractionary policy.


    - Neutral: This type of policy is usually undertaken when an economy is in equilibrium. In this instance, government spending is fully funded by tax revenue, which has a neutral effect on the level of economic activity.
    - Expansionary: This type of policy is usually undertaken during recessions to increase the level of economic activity. In this instance, the government spends more money than it collects in taxes.
    - Contractionary: This type of policy is undertaken to pay down government debt and to cap inflation. In this case, government spending is lower than tax revenue.

When setting fiscal policy, the government can take an active role in changing its spending or the level of taxation. These actions lead to an increase or decrease in aggregate demand, which is reflected in the shift of the aggregate demand (AD) curve to the right or left respectively.

Fiscal policy impacts GDP through the fiscal multiplier.

- Fiscal multiplier: The ratio of a change in national income to the change in government spending that causes it.
- Automatic stabilizer: A budget policy that automatically changes to stabilize fluctuations in GDP.
- Discretionary policy: Actions taken in response to changes in the economy. These acts do not follow a strict set of rules, rather, they use subjective judgment to treat each situation in unique manner.
- Appropriations bill: A legislative motion that authorizes the government to spend money.
- Balanced budget: A (usually government) budget in which income and expenditure are equal over a set period of time.
- Cyclically balanced budget: Occurs when the government runs a deficit during recessions and lean years but a surplus during periods of significant growth.

## Business Cycles
"Business cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the aggregate economic activity of nations…a cycle consists of expansions occurring at about the same time in many economic activities, followed by similarly general recessions…this sequence of changes is recurrent but not periodic."

In essence, business cycles are marked by the alternation of the phases of expansion and contraction in aggregate economic activity, and the comovement among economic variables in each phase of the cycle. 

## Recessions
**Recession**

A recession is actually a specific sort of vicious cycle, with cascading declines in output, employment, income, and sales that feed back into a further drop in output, spreading rapidly from industry to industry and region to region.

**Recovery**

On the flip side, a business cycle recovery begins when that recessionary vicious cycle reverses and becomes a virtuous cycle, with rising output triggering job gains, rising incomes, and increasing sales that feed back into a further rise in output.

The severity of a recession is measured by the three D’s: depth, diffusion, and duration, and the strength of an expansion by how pronounced, pervasive and persistent it is.

**Depression**

A depression is a severe and prolonged downturn in economic activity. In economics, a depression is commonly defined as an extreme recession that lasts three or more years or which leads to a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) of at least 10%. in a given year. Depressions are relatively less frequent than milder recessions, and tend to be accompanied by high unemployment and low inflation.

A recession is a normal part of the business cycle that generally occurs when GDP contracts for at least two quarters. A depression, on the other hand, is an extreme fall in economic activity that lasts for years, rather than just several quarters.

**The Great Recession**
The Great Recession was the sharp decline in economic activity during the late 2000s.

The Great Recession refers to the economic downturn from 2007 to 2009 after the bursting of the U.S. housing bubble and the global financial crisis.

In response to the Great Recession, unprecedented fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policy was unleashed by federal authorities, which some, but not all, credit with the subsequent recovery.

**The Great Depression**

The Great Depression was the greatest and longest economic recession in modern world history.

It began with the U.S. stock market crash of 1929 and did not end until 1946 after World War II. 

    - The American public began a frenzy of investing in the speculative market in the 1920s.
    - The 1929 market crash wiped out a great deal of nominal wealth for individuals and businesses alike.
    - Other factors including inactivity followed by overaction by the Fed also contributed to the Great Depression.
    - Both Presidents Hoover and Roosevelt tried to mitigate the impact of the depression through government policies.
    - Neither the government policies or the beginning of WWII can be single-handedly credited with ending the depression.
    - Trade routes created during WWII remained open and helped the market recover.

## Financial Crises
In a financial crisis, asset prices see a steep decline in value, businesses and consumers are unable to pay their debts, and financial institutions experience liquidity shortages.

A financial crisis is often associated with a panic or a bank run during which investors sell off assets or withdraw money from savings accounts because they fear that the value of those assets will drop if they remain in a financial institution. 

Other situations that may be labeled a financial crisis include the bursting of a speculative financial bubble, a stock market crash, a sovereign default, or a currency crisis.

A financial crisis may be limited to banks or spread throughout a single economy, the economy of a region, or economies worldwide. 

## Banking Crises
Banks can fail for several different reasons:

    - Bank Run: A bank occurs when many people try to withdraw their deposits at the same time. As much of the capital in a bank is tied up in investments, the bank’s liquidity will sometimes fail to meet the consumer demand. This can quickly induce panic in the public, driving up withdrawals as everyone tries to get their money back from a system that they are increasingly skeptical of. This leads to a bank panic which can result in a systemic banking crisis, which simply means that all of the free capital in the banking system is withdrawn.
    - Stock Market Positive Feedback Loops: One particularly interesting cause of banking disasters is a similar positive feedback loop effect in the stock markets, which was a much more dynamic factor in more recent banking crises (i.e. 2007-2009 sub-prime mortgage disaster). John Maynard Keynes once compared financial markets to a beauty contest, where investors are merely trying to pick what is attractive to other investors. There is a profound truth to this, creating an interdependent and potentially self-fulfilling investment thought process. This can create dramatic rises and falls (bubbles and crashes), which in turn can throw banks with poorly designed leverage into huge losses.
    - Regulatory Failure: One of the simplest ways in which bank crises can occur is a lack of governmental oversight. As noted above, banks often leverage themselves to capture gains despite extremely high risks (such as over-dependence on derivatives).
    - Contagion: Due to globalization and international interdependence, the failure of one economy can create something of a domino effect. In 2008, when the U.S. economy collapses, the reduced buying power and economic output from that economy dramatically damaged all economies dependent upon it (which includes most of the world). This is called contagion.
