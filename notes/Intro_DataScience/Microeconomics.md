# <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction
Microeconomics examines the behavior individual consumers and firms within the market, including assessment of the role of preferences and constraints. 

Microeconomics studies how the behaviors of individual market participants—such as buyers, sellers, and business owners—affect the allocation of resources.

# <a id="principles"></a>Principles
**Individual choice**: is the decision by an individual of what to do, which necessarily involves a decision of what not to do.

Basic principles behind the individual choices:

    1. Resources are scarce.
    2. The true cost of an item is its opportunity cost; The real cost of something is what you must give up to get it.
    3. “How much?” is a decision at the margin
    4. People usually take advantage of opportunities to make themselves better off. People usually respond to incentives.
    
**Interaction** of choices my choices affect your choices, and vice versa is a feature of most economic situations.

Principles that underlie the interaction of individual choices:

    5. There are gains from trade. This increase in output is due to specialization.
    6. Markets move toward equilibrium.
    7. Resources should be used as efficiently as possible to achieve society's goals.
    8. Markets usually lead to efficiency.
    9. When markets don't achieve efficiency, government intervention can improve society's welfare.
    
Principles that underlie economy wide interactions:

    10. One person's spending is another person's income.
    11. Overall spending sometimes gets out of line with the economy's productive capacity.
    12. Government policies can change spending.
    
# <a id="models"></a>Models
A model is a simplified representation of a real situation that is used to better understand real life situations. 

How? By creating a real but simplified economy / By simulating an economy on a computer.

The “other things equal” assumption means that all other relevant factors remain unchanged.

- Trade-offs - PPF

The production possibility frontier (PPF) illustrates the trade offs facing an economy that produces only two goods.

It shows the maximum quantity of one good that can be produced for any given production of the other good.

The PPF improves our understanding of trade offs by considering a simplified economy that produces only two goods by showing this trade off graphically.

Comparative VS Absolute advantage

An individual has a comparative advantage in producing a good or service if the opportunity cost of producing the good is lower for that individual than for other people.

An individual has an absolute advantage in an activity if he or she can do it better than other people. Having an absolute advantage is not the same thing as having a comparative advantage.

- Transactions - Circular-Flow Diagram

Trade takes the form of barter when people directly exchange goods or services they have for goods or services they want.

The circular flow diagram is a model that represents the transactions in an economy by flows around a circle.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125052582-6ba27780-e0a4-11eb-9166-8c66e1c61006.png)

    - A household is a person or a group of people that share their income.
    - A firm is an organization that produces goods and services for sale.
    - Firms sell goods and services that they produce to households in markets for goods and services
    - Firms buy the resources they need to produce goods and services factors of production in factor markets
    - Ultimately, factor markets determine the economy’s income distribution how total income is divided among the owners of the various factors of production.
    
- Using Models

_Positive_ economics is the branch of economic analysis that describes the way the economy actually works.

_Normative_ economics makes prescriptions about the way the economy should work.

A _forecast_ is a simple prediction of the future.

- When and Why Economists disagree

There are two main reasons economists disagree:

    1. Which simplifications to make in a model
    2. Values
    
# <a id="supply-and-demand"></a>Supply and Demand
A competitive market:

Many buyers and sellers

Same good or service

The supply and demand model is a model of how a competitive market works.

Five key elements:

    - Demand curve
    - Supply curve
    - Demand and supply curve shifts
    - Market equilibrium
    - Changes in the market equilibrium

## <a id="demand"></a>Demand

A **demand schedule** shows how much of a good or service consumers will want to buy at different prices.

A **demand curve** is the graphical representation of the demand schedule. It shows how much of a good or service consumers want to buy at any given price.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125054038-110a1b00-e0a6-11eb-86c0-3da1360f8624.png)

A **shift of the demand curve** is a change in the quantity demanded at any given price, represented by the change of the original demand curve to a new position, denoted by a new demand curve.

A **movement along the demand curve** is a change in the quantity demanded of a good that is the result of a change in that good’s price.

An **increase in demand** means a leftward shift of the demand curve: at any given price, consumers demand a larger quantity than before.

What causes a demand curve to shift?

- Changes in the Prices of Related Goods

      - Substitutes : Two goods are substitutes if a fall in the price of one of the goods makes consumers less willing to buy the other good.
      - Complements : Two goods are complements if a fall in the price of one good makes people more willing to buy the other good.
 
- Changes in Income

      - Normal Goods : When a rise in income increases the demand for a good the normal case we say that the good is a normal good.
      - Inferior Goods: When a rise in income decreases the demand for a good, it is an inferior good.

- Changes in Tastes

- Changes in Expectations

The **market demand curve** is the horizontal sum of the individual demand curves of all consumers in that market.

## <a id="supply"></a>Supply

A **supply schedule** shows how much of a good or service would be supplied at different prices.

A **supply curve** shows graphically how much of agood or service people are willing to sell at any given price.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125055207-3fd4c100-e0a7-11eb-8dfe-6d73b8790d8f.png)

A **shift of the supply curve** is a change in the quantity supplied of a good at any given price.

A **movement along the supply curve** is a change in the quantity supplied of a good that is the result of a change in that good’s price.

Any “increase in supply” means a rightward shift of the supply curve: at any given price, there is an increase in the quantity supplied.

Any “decrease in supply” means a leftward shift of the supply curve: at any given price, there is a decrease in the quantity supplied.

What causes a supply curve to shift?

- Changes in input prices (An input is a good that is used to produce another good)
- Changes in the prices of related goods and services
- Changes in technology
- Changes in expectations
- Changes in the number of producers

The **market supply curve** is the horizontal sum of the individual supply curves of all firms in that market.

## <a id="equilibrium"></a>Equilibrium
**Equilibrium** in a competitive market: when the quantity demanded of a good equals the quantity supplied of that good.

The price at which this takes place is the equilibrium price (or market clearing price)

Every buyer finds a seller and vice versa.

The quantity of the good bought and sold at that price is the equilibrium quantity.

Market equilibrium occurs at point E, where the supply curve and the demand curve intersect.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125056067-28e29e80-e0a8-11eb-82a6-692ad4d0875d.png)

- Surplus

There is a surplus of a good when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded.

Surpluses occur when the price is above its equilibrium level.

- Shortage

There is a shortage of a good when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. 

Shortages occur when the price is below its equilibrium level.

- Simultaneous shifts of Supply and Demand

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125056454-8aa30880-e0a8-11eb-8eaa-e6c5dc467fb3.png)

# <a id="surplus"></a>Surplus
A surplus describes the amount of an asset or resource that exceeds the portion that's actively utilized.

## <a id="consumer-surplus"></a>Consumer Surplus

A consumer's _willingness to pay_ for a good is the maximum price at which he or she would buy that good.

**Individual consumer surplus** is the net gain to an individual buyer from the purchase of a good.

It is equal to the difference between the buyer's willingness to pay and the price paid.

**Total consumer surplus** is the sum of the individual consumer surpluses of all the buyers of a good.

The total consumer surplus generated by purchases of a good at a given price is equal to the area below the demand curve but above that price.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125076495-46bbfd80-e0c0-11eb-99df-6a58d3636ae9.png)

How changing prices affect consumer surplus:

A fall in the price of a good increases consumer surplus through two channels:

1. a gain to consumers who would have bought at the original price
2. a gain to consumers who are persuaded to buy by the lower price

## <a id="producer-surplus"></a>Producer Surplus

A potential seller s cost is the lowest price at which he or she is willing to sell a good.

Individual producer surplus is the net gain to a seller from selling a good. It is equal to the difference between the price received and the seller s cost.

Total producer surplus in a market is the sum of the individual producer surpluses of all the sellers of a good.

The total producer surplus from sales of a good at a given price is the area above the supply curve but below that price.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125076788-a0bcc300-e0c0-11eb-80cc-3c601b3cd04f.png)

Changes in producer surplus:

When the price of a good rises, producer surplus increases through two channels:

1. the gains of those who would have supplied the good even at the original, lower price
2. the gains of those who are induced to supply the good by the higher price

## <a id="total-surplus"></a>Total Surplus
The total surplus generated in a market is the total net gain to consumers and producers from trading in the market. It is the sum of the producer and the consumer surplus.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125077398-5a1b9880-e0c1-11eb-924c-2d61c8c48cb5.png)

The previous graph shows that both consumers and producers are better off because there is a market in this good; i.e., there are gains from trade .

These gains from trade are the reason everyone is better off participating in a market economy than they would be if each individual tried to be self sufficient.

**Claim**: The maximum possible total surplus is achieved at market equilibrium.

The market equilibrium allocates the consumption of the good among potential consumers and sales of the good among potential sellers in a way that achieves the highest possible gain to society.

By comparing the total surplus generated by the consumption and production choices in the market equilibrium to the surplus generated by a different set of production and consumption choices, we can show that any change from the market equilibrium reduces total surplus.

Three ways in which you might try to increase the total surplus:

    - Reallocate consumption among consumers
    - Reallocate sales among sellers
    - Change the quantity traded
    
Market equilibrium maximizes total surplus:

    1. Market equilibrium allocates consumption of the good to the potential buyers who value it the most, as indicated by the fact that they have the highest willingness to pay.
    2. It allocates sales to the potential sellers who most value the right to sell the good, as indicated by the fact that they have the lowest cost.
    3. It ensures that every consumer who makes a purchase values the good more than every seller who makes a sale, so that all transactions are mutually beneficial.
    4. It ensures that every potential buyer who doesn’t make a purchase values the good less than every potential seller who doesn’t make a sale, so that no mutually beneficial transactions are missed. 
    
As a result of these four functions, any way of allocating the good other than the market equilibrium outcome lowers total surplus.

Three caveats:

    - First, although a market may be efficient, it isn’t necessarily fair . In fact, fairness, or equity , is often in conflict with efficiency.
    - The second caveat is that markets sometimes fail.
    - Third, even when the market equilibrium maximizes total surplus, this does not mean that it results in the best outcome for every individual consumer and producer.
    
Why markets typically work so well:

In the end, well functioning markets owe their effectiveness to two powerful features: property rights and the role of prices as economic signals

    - Property rights are the rights of owners of valuable items, whether resources or goods, to dispose of those items as they choose.
    - An economic signal is any piece of information that helps people make better economic decisions.
    
A market or an economy is inefficient if there are missed opportunities.

The three principal sources of market failure are:

    1. attempts to capture more resources that produce inefficiencies
    2. side effects from certain transactions, and
    3. problems in the nature of the goods themselves.
    
# <a id="price-controls-and-quotas"></a>Price Controls and Quotas
The market price moves to the level at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. But, this equilibrium price does not necessarily please either buyers or sellers.

Therefore, the government intervenes to regulate prices by imposing **price controls**, which are legal restrictions on how high or low a market price may go.

- **Price ceiling** is the maximum price sellers are allowed to charge for a good or service.
- **Price floor** is the minimum price buyers are required to pay for a good or service.

Price ceilings are typically imposed during crises—wars, harvest failures, natural disasters—because these events often lead to sudden price increases that hurt many people but produce big gains for a lucky few.

How price ceilings cause inefficiency:

    - Inefficiently low quantity
      - **Deadweight loss** is the loss in total surplus that occurs whenever an action or a policy reduces the quantity transacted below the efficient market equilibrium quantity
    - Inefficient allocation to customers
    - Wasted resources
    - Inefficiently low quality
    - Black markets
    
Sometimes governments intervene to push market prices up instead of down.

The **minimum wage** is a legal floor on the wage rate, which is the market price of labor.

Just like price ceilings, price floors are intended to help some people but generate predictable and undesirable side effects.

How price floors cause inefficiency:

The persistent surplus that results from a price floor creates missed opportunities (inefficiencies) that resemble those created by the shortage that results from a price ceiling.

These include:
    
    - Deadweight loss from inefficiently low quantity
    - Inefficient allocation of sales among sellers
    - Wasted resources 
    - Inefficiently high quality
    - Temptation to break the law by selling below the legal price
    
- Controlling quantities

A **quantity control, or quota**, is an upper limit on the quantity of some good that can be bought or sold. The total amount of the good that can be legally transacte is the **quota limit**.

A **license** gives its owner the right to supply a good.

The **demand price** of a given quantity is the price at which consumers will demand that quantity.

The **supply price** of a given quantity is the price at which producers will supply that quantity.

A quantity control, or quota, drives a wedge between the demand price and the supply price of a good; that is, the price paid by buyers ends up being higher than that received by sellers.

The difference between the demand and supply price at the quota limit is the **quota rent**, the earnings that accrue to the license-holder from ownership of the right to sell the good.

It is equal to the market price of the license when the licenses are traded.

There is deadweight loss because some mutually beneficial transactions don’t occur.

There are incentives for illegal activities.

# <a id="elasticity"></a>Elasticity
The **price elasticity of demand** is the ratio of the percent change in the quantity demanded to the percent change in the price as we move along the demand curve (dropping the minus sign).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125087838-20e92580-e0cd-11eb-9354-d41a53a87868.png)

The _midpoint method_ is a technique for calculating the percent change. In this approach, we calculate changes in a variable compared with the average, or midpoint, of the starting and final values.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125087924-38c0a980-e0cd-11eb-95c8-06857509f967.png)

Two extreme cases of price elasticity of demand:

• Demand is perfectly inelastic when the quantity demanded does not respond at all to changes in the price. When demand is perfectly inelastic, the demand curve is a vertical line.

• Demand is perfectly elastic when any price increase will cause the quantity demanded to drop to zero. When demand is perfectly elastic, the demand curve is a horizontal line.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125088112-66a5ee00-e0cd-11eb-8bab-42c1b1082dbe.png)

    • Demand is elastic if the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1.
    • Demand is inelastic if the price elasticity of demand is less than 1.
    • Demand is unit-elastic if the price elasticity of demand is exactly 1.
    
Why does it matter whether demand is Unit-Elastic, Inelastic, or Elastic?:

Because this classification predicts how changes in the price of a good will affect the total revenue earned by producers from the sale of that good.

The total revenue is defined as the total value of sales of a good or service:

Total Revenue = Price × Quantity Sold

Elasticity and Total Revenue

When a seller raises the price of a good, there are two countervailing effects in action (except in the rare case of a good with perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic demand):

  - A _price effect_: After a price increase, each unit sold sells at a higher price, which tends to raise revenue.
  - A _quantity effect_: After a price increase, fewer units are sold, which tends to lower revenue.

        - If demand for a good is elastic (the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1), an increase in price reduces total revenue. 
        - If demand for a good is inelastic (the price elasticity of demand is less than 1), a higher price increases total revenue.
        - If demand for a good is unit-elastic (the price elasticity of demand is exactly 1), an increase in price does not change total revenue.

Price elasticity of demand is determined by:

- whether close substitutes are available
- whether the good is a necessity or a luxury
- share of income spent on the good
- time

The **cross-price elasticity** of demand between two goods measures the effect of the change in one good’s price on the quantity demanded of the other good.

It is equal to the percent change in the quantity demanded of one good divided by the percent change in the other good’s price.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125088915-2bf08580-e0ce-11eb-872e-b062b5e1af6b.png)

- Goods are _substitutes_ when the cross-price elasticity of demand is positive.
- Goods are _complements_ when the cross-price elasticity of demand is negative.

The **income elasticity of demand** is the percent change in the quantity of a good demanded when a consumer’s income changes divided by the percent change in the consumer’s income.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125089010-41fe4600-e0ce-11eb-846c-9e86f04e75f2.png)

When the income elasticity of demand is positive, the good is a _normal good_; that is, the quantity demanded at any given price increases as income increases.

When the income elasticity of demand is negative, the good is an _inferior good_; that is, the quantity demanded at any given price decreases as income increases.

---

The **price elasticity of supply** is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity of a good supplied to the price of that good.

It is the ratio of the percent change in the quantity supplied to the percent change in the price as we move along the supply curve.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125089178-7114b780-e0ce-11eb-9d1c-80491e2a3d33.png)

• There is perfectly inelastic supply when the price elasticity of supply is zero, so that changes in the price of the good have no effect on the quantity supplied. A perfectly inelastic supply curve is a vertical line.

• There is perfectly elastic supply when even a tiny increase or reduction in the price will lead to very large changes in the quantity supplied, so that the price elasticity of supply is infinite. A perfectly elastic supply curve is a horizontal line.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125089288-90134980-e0ce-11eb-8f7e-0c357bf8a82f.png)

Factors that determine the price elasticity of supply:

- The Availability of Inputs: The price elasticity of supply tends to be large when inputs are readily available and can be shifted into and out of production at a relatively low cost. It tends to be small when inputs are difficult to obtain.
- Time: The price elasticity of supply tends to grow larger as producers have more time to respond to a price change. This means that the long-run price elasticity of supply is often higher than the short-run elasticity.

# <a id="taxes"></a>Taxes

- Excise Tax

An excise tax is a tax on sales of a good or service.
It:
  - raise the price paid by buyers
  - reduce the price received by sellers

Excise taxes also drive a wedge between the two prices.

- Tax Incidence

The incidence of a tax is a measure of who really pays it.

Who really bears the tax burden (in the form of higher prices to consumers and lower prices to sellers) does not depend on who officially pays the tax. Depending on the shapes of supply and demand curves, the incidence of an excise tax may be divided differently.

The wedge between the demand price and supply price becomes the government’s **tax revenue**.

    When the price elasticity of demand is higher than the price elasticity of supply, an excise tax falls mainly on producers.
    When the price elasticity of supply is higher than the price elasticity of demand, an excise tax falls mainly on consumers.
    
So elasticity — not who officially pays the tax — determines the incidence of an excise tax.

- Tax Rates

A tax rate is the amount of tax people are required to pay per unit of whatever is being taxed.

In general, doubling the excise tax rate on a good or service won’t double the amount of revenue collected, because the tax increase will reduce the quantity of the good or service transacted.

In some cases, raising the tax rate may actually reduce the amount of revenue the government collects.

{A tax reduces both the consumer surplus and the producer surplus.}

- Deadweight Loss of a Tax

The deadweight loss caused by the tax represents the total surplus lost to society because of the tax—that is, the amount of surplus that would have been generated by transactions that now do not take place because of the tax.

- Cost of collecting Taxes

The administrative costs of a tax are the resources used by government to collect the tax, and by taxpayers to pay it, over and above the amount of the tax, as well as to evade it.

The total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of its deadweight loss and its administrative costs. The general rule for economic policy is that, other things equal, a tax system should be designed to minimize the total inefficiency it imposes on society.

- Deadweight Loss and Elasticities

To minimize the efficiency costs of taxation, one should choose to tax only those goods for which demand or supply, or both, is relatively inelastic.

For such goods, a tax has little effect on behavior because behavior is relatively unresponsive to changes in the price.

If the goal in choosing whom to tax is to minimize deadweight loss, then taxes should be imposed on goods and services that have the most inelastic response — that is, goods and services for which consumers or producers will change their behavior the least in response to the tax

- Tax Fairness and Tax Efficiency

Two principles:

  - According to the _benefits principle_ of tax fairness, those who benefit from public spending should bear the burden of the tax that pays for that spending.
  - According to the _ability-to-pay principle_ of tax fairness, those with greater ability to pay a tax should pay more tax.

A **lump-sum tax** is the same for everyone, regardless of any actions people take.

In a well-designed tax system, there is a trade-off between equity and efficiency: the system can be made more efficient only by making it less fair, and vice versa.

- The Tax System

The **tax base** is the measure or value, such as income or property value, that determines how much tax an individual or firm pays.

The **tax structure** specifies how the tax depends on the tax base.

Once the tax base has been defined, the next question is how the tax depends on the base. The simplest tax structure is a **proportional tax**, also sometimes called a flat tax, which is the same percentage of the base regardless of the taxpayer’s income or wealth.

Some important taxes and their tax bases are as follows:

• _Income tax_: a tax that depends on the income of an individual or a family from wages and investments

• _Payroll tax_: a tax that depends on the earnings an employer pays to an employee

• _Sales tax_: a tax that depends on the value of goods sold (also known as an excise tax)

• _Profits tax_: a tax that depends on a firm’s profits

• _Property tax_: a tax that depends on the value of property, such as the value of a home

• _Wealth tax_: a tax that depends on an individual’s wealth

Once the tax base has been defined, the next question is how the tax depends on the base. The simplest tax structure is a proportional tax, also sometimes called a _flat tax_, which is the same percentage of the base regardless of the taxpayer’s income or wealth.

• A **progressive tax** takes a larger share of the income of highincome taxpayers than of low-income taxpayers.

• A **regressive tax** takes a smaller share of the income of highincome taxpayers than of low-income taxpayers.

• The **marginal tax rate** is the percentage of an increase in income that is taxed away.

# <a id="decision-making"></a>Decision Making

- Opportunity Cost and Decisions

An **explicit cost** is a cost that involves actually laying out money.

An **implicit cost** does not require an outlay of money; it is measured by the value, in dollar terms, of the benefits that are forgone.

- Accounting Profit VS Economic Profit

The **accounting profit** of a business is the business’s revenue minus the explicit costs and depreciation.

The **economic profit** of a business is the business’s revenue minus the opportunity cost of its resources. It is often less than the accounting profit.

- Capital

The **capital** of a business is the value of its assets— equipment, buildings, tools, inventory, and financial assets.

The **implicit cost of capital** is the opportunity cost of the capital used by a business—the income the owner could have realized from that capital if it had been used in its next best alternative way.

- Marginal Cost

The **marginal cost** of producing a good or service is the additional cost incurred by producing one more unit of that good or service.

**Constant marginal cost** occurs when the cost of producing an additional unit is the same as the cost of producing the previous unit.

**Decreasing marginal cost**: This arises when marginal cost falls as the number of units produced increases.

- Marginal Benefit

The **marginal benefit** of producing a good or service is the additional benefit earned from producing one more unit of that good or service.

- Marginal Cost — Marginal Benefit

The marginal cost curve shows how the cost of producing one more unit depends on the quantity that has already been produced.

Production of a good or service has increasing marginal cost when each additional unit costs more to produce than the previous one.

The marginal benefit of a good or service is the additional benefit derived from producing one more unit of that good or service.

The marginal benefit curve shows how the benefit from producing one more unit depends on the quantity that has already been produced.

There is **decreasing marginal benefit** from an activity when each additional unit of the activity produces less benefit than the previous unit.

- Marginal Analysis

The **optimal quantity** is the quantity that generates the maximum possible total net gain.

The **principle of marginal analysis** says that the optimal quantity is the quantity at which marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost.

- Sunk Cost

A **sunk cost** is a cost that has already been incurred and is nonrecoverable.

Sunk costs should be ignored in making decisions about future actions.

- Behavioral Economics

Rather than act like “economic computing machines,” people often make choices that fall short – sometimes far short – of the greatest possible economic outcome, or payoff.

It’s well documented that people consistently engage in irrational behavior – choosing an option that leaves them worse off than other, available options.

If you are rational, you will choose the available option that leads to the outcome you most prefer.

Reasons why people might prefer a lower economic payoff:

    - concerns about fairness
    - bounded rationality
    - risk aversion
    
Sometimes, instead of being rational, people are irrational – they make choices that leave them worse off than if they had chosen another available option.

The _utility_ of a consumer is a measure of the satisfaction the consumer derives from the consumption of goods and services.

An individual’s consumption bundle is the collection of all the goods and services consumed by that individual.

An individual’s utility function gives the total utility generated by his or her consumption bundle. The unit of utility is a util.

The **marginal utility** of a good or service is the change in total utility generated by consuming one additional unit of that good or service. The **marginal utility curve** shows how marginal utility depends on the quantity of a good or service consumed.

The **principle of diminishing marginal utility** says that each successive unit of a good or service consumed adds less to total utility than the previous unit.

- Budgets

A **budget constraint** requires that the cost of a consumer’s consumption bundle be no more than the consumer’s total income.

A consumer’s **consumption possibilities** is the set of all consumption bundles that can be consumed given the consumer’s income and prevailing prices.

A consumer’s **budget line** shows the consumption bundles available to a consumer who spends all of his or her income.

The **optimal consumption bundle** is the consumption bundle that maximizes a consumer’s total utility given his or her budget constraint.

The **marginal utility per dollar** spent on a good or service is the additional utility from spending one more dollar on that good or service.

The **optimal consumption rule** says that when a consumer maximizes utility, the marginal utility per dollar spent must be the same for all goods and services in the consumption bundle.

Changes in the price of a good affect the quantity consumed in two possible ways: the _substitution effect_ and the _income effect_. For normal goods, the substitution and income effects reinforce each other. For inferior goods, however, they work in opposite directions.

# <a id="inputs-and-costs"></a>Inputs and Costs

A **production function** is the relationship between the quantity of inputs a firm uses and the quantity of output it produces.

A **fixed input** is an input whose quantity is fixed for a particular period and cannot be varied.

A **variable input** is an input whose quantity the firm can vary at any time.

The **long run** is the period in which all inputs can be varied.

The **short run** is the period in which at least one input is fixed.

The **total product curve** shows how the quantity of output depends on the quantity of the variable input, for a given quantity of the fixed input.

The _marginal product of an input_ is the additional quantity of output that is produced by using one more unit of that input.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125157782-2dbd5600-e16d-11eb-85a5-630d6cbf38a5.png)

There are **diminishing returns to an input** when an increase in the quantity of that input, holding the levels of all other inputs fixed, leads to a decline in the marginal product of that input.

A **fixed cost** is a cost that does not depend on the quantity of output produced. It is the cost of the fixed input.

A **variable cost** is a cost that depends on the quantity of output produced. It is the cost of the variable input.

The **total cost** of producing a given quantity of output is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost of producing that quantity of output.

TC = FC + VC

The _total cost curve_ becomes steeper as more output is produced due to diminishing returns.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125157834-6bba7a00-e16d-11eb-981f-25f802f29761.png)

**Average total cost**, often referred to simply as _average cost_, is total cost divided by quantity of output produced.

ATC = TC/Q = (Total Cost) / (Quantity of Output)

A _U-shaped average total cost curve_ falls at low levels of output, then rises at higher levels.

**Average fixed cost** is the fixed cost per unit of output.

AFC = FC/Q = (Fixed Cost) / (Quantity of Output)

**Average variable cost** is the variable cost per unit of output.

AVC = VC/Q= (Variable Cost) / (Quantity of Output)

Increasing output, therefore, has two opposing effects on average total cost—the spreading effect and the diminishing returns effect:

    - The spreading effect: the larger the output, the greater the quantity of output over which fixed cost is spread, leading to lower the average fixed cost
    - The diminishing returns effect: the larger the output, the greater the amount of variable input required to produce additional units leading to higher average variable cost
    
Short-Run vs Long-Run costs

In the short run, fixed cost is completely outside the control of a firm. But all inputs are variable in the long run: This means that in the long run fixed cost may also be varied.

In the long run, in other words, a firm’s fixed cost becomes a variable it can choose.

The firm will choose its fixed cost in the long run based on the level of output it expects to produce.

The **long-run average total cost curve** shows the relationship between output and average total cost when fixed cost has been chosen to minimize average total cost for each level of output.

- Returns to Scale

There are **increasing returns to scale (economies of scale)** when long-run average total cost declines as output increases.
 
There are decreasing returns to scale **(diseconomies of scale)** when long-run average total cost increases as output increases.

There are **constant returns to scale** when long-run average total cost is constant as output increases.

# <a id="perfect-competition"></a>Perfect Competition

• A **price-taking producer** is a producer whose actions have no effect on the market price of the good it sells.

• A **price-taking consumer** is a consumer whose actions have no effect on the market price of the good he or she buys.

• A **perfectly competitive market** is a market in which all market participants are price-takers.

• A **perfectly competitive industry** is an industry in which producers are price-takers.

Two necessary conditions for perfect competition:

    1. For an industry to be perfectly competitive, it must contain many producers, none of whom have a large **market share**.
    1.1. A producer’s market share is the fraction of the total industry output accounted for by that producer’s output.
    2. An industry can be perfectly competitive only if consumers regard the products of all producers as equivalent.
    2.2. A good is a **standardized product**, also known as a **commodity**, when consumers regard the products of different producers as the same good.
    
There is **free entry and exit** into and from an industry when new producers can easily enter into or leave that industry.

Free entry and exit ensure:

    - the number of producers in an industry can adjust to changing market conditions;
    - producers in an industry cannot artificially keep other firms out.
    
**Marginal revenue** is the change in total revenue generated by an additional unit of output.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158076-dc15cb00-e16e-11eb-8c9e-d9359f4562c2.png)

The **optimal output rule** says that profit is maximized by producing the quantity of output at which the marginal cost of the last unit produced is equal to its marginal revenue.

The **price-taking firm’s optimal output rule** says that a pricetaking firm’s profit is maximized by producing the quantity of output at which the marginal cost of the last unit produced is equal to the market price.

The **marginal revenue curve** shows how marginal revenue varies as output varies.

When is production profitable?
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158099-0e272d00-e16f-11eb-854a-5ee0c4f11eb4.png)

The **break-even price** of a price-taking firm is the market price at which it earns zero profits.

    Whenever market price exceeds minimum average total cost, the producer is profitable.
    Whenever the market price equals minimum average total cost, the producer breaks even.
    Whenever market price is less than minimum average total cost, the producer is unprofitable.

The short-run individual supply curve shows how an individual producer’s optimal output quantity depends on the market price, taking fixed cost as given.

A firm will cease production in the short run if the market price falls below the shutdown price, which is equal to minimum average variable cost.

The **industry supply curve** shows the relationship between the price of a good and the total output of the industry as a whole.

The short-run industry supply curve shows how the quantity supplied by an industry depends on the market price given a fixed number of producers.

There is a **short-run market equilibrium** when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, taking the number of producers as given.

A market is in **long-run market equilibrium** when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, given that sufficient time has elapsed for entry into and exit from the industry to occur.

The short-run industry supply curve shows how the quantity supplied by an industry depends on the market price given a fixed number of producers.

There is a short-run market equilibrium when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, taking the number of producers as given.

A market is in _long-run market equilibrium_ when the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, given that sufficient time has elapsed for entry into and exit from the industry to occur.

Three conclusions about the cost of production and efficiency in the long-run equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry:

    1) In a perfectly competitive industry in equilibrium, the value of marginal cost is the same for all firms.
    2) In a perfectly competitive industry with free entry and exit, each firm will have zero economic profits in long-run equilibrium.
    3) The long-run market equilibrium of a perfectly competitive industry is efficient: no mutually beneficial transactions go unexploited.
    
# <a id="monopoly"></a>Monopoly

Types of Market structure:

- Perfect Competition
- Monopoly
- Oligopoly
- Monopolistic Competition

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158339-c1dcec80-e170-11eb-90ef-cb2a57e1faa6.png)

A _monopolist_ is a firm that is the only producer of a good that has no close substitutes. An industry controlled by a monopolist is known as a **monopoly**.

The ability of a monopolist to raise its price above the competitive level by reducing output is known as **market power**.

A monopolist has market power, and as a result will charge higher prices and produce less output than a competitive industry. (This generates profit for the monopolist in the short run and long run)

Profits will not persist in the long run unless there is a barrier to entry. This can take the form of:

    - control of natural resources or inputs
    - increasing returns to scale
    technological superiority
    government-created barriers including patents and copyrights

A **natural monopoly** exists when increasing returns to scale provide a large cost advantage to a single firm that produces all of an industry’s output.

It arises when increasing returns to scale provide a large cost advantage to having all of an industry’s output produced by a single firm.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158397-2f891880-e171-11eb-9fcd-45efd38be4fa.png)

Demand curve of a Monopolist

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158418-4e87aa80-e171-11eb-9eed-b589572a349c.png)

An increase in production by a monopolist has two opposing effects on revenue:

    - A quantity effect: one more unit is sold, increasing total revenue by the price at which the unit is sold.
    - A price effect: in order to sell the last unit, the monopolist must cut the market price on all units sold. This decreases total revenue.
    
To maximize profit, the monopolist compares marginal cost with marginal revenue.

So the monopolist maximizes its profit by using the optimal output rule:
At the monopolist’s profit-maximizing quantity of output:
MR = MC

Monopoly vs Perfect Competition

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158452-94447300-e171-11eb-9e0b-f0264bd52a5c.png)

Monopoly and Public Policy

By reducing output and raising price above marginal cost, a monopolist captures some of the consumer surplus as profit and causes deadweight loss.
(To avoid deadweight loss, government policy attempts to prevent monopoly behavior)

When monopolies are “created” rather than natural, governments should act to prevent them from forming and should break up existing ones.

The government policies used to prevent or eliminate monopolies are known as _antitrust policies_.

Public policy dealing with Natural Monopoly:

    1) One answer is public ownership, but publicly owned companies are often poorly run. In public ownership of a monopoly, the good is supplied by the government or by a firm owned by the government.
    2) A common response in the United States is price regulation. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist does not create shortages as long as it is not set too low.
    
Price Discrimination

Many (if not most) monopolists find that they can increase their profits by charging different customers different prices for the same good: they engage in **price discrimination**.

Price discrimination is profitable when consumers differ in their sensitivity to the price. (A monopolist would like to charge high prices to consumers willing to pay them without driving away others who are willing to pay less.)

A monopolist able to charge each consumer according to his or her willingness to pay for the good achieves perfect price discrimination and does not cause inefficiency because all mutually beneficial transactions are exploited.

In this case, the consumers do not get any consumer surplus! The entire surplus is captured by the monopolist in the form of profit.

**Perfect price discrimination** takes place when a monopolist charges each consumer according to his or her willingness to pay—the maximum that the consumer is willing to pay.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125158542-319fa700-e172-11eb-9871-9f1173d52c91.png)

Perfect price discrimination is probably never possible in practice.

# <a id="oligopoly"></a>Oligopoly

In addition to perfect competition and monopoly, oligopoly and monopolistic competition are also important types of market structure. They are forms of imperfect competition.

**Oligopoly** is a common market structure.

It arises from the same forces that lead to monopoly, except in
a weaker form. It is an industry with only a small number of producers. A producer in such an industry is known as an **oligopolist**.

When no one firm has a monopoly, but producers nonetheless realize that they can affect market prices, an industry is characterized by **imperfect competition**.

An oligopoly consisting of only two firms is a **duopoly**. Each firm is a _duopolist_.

With only two firms in the industry, each would realize that by producing more, it would drive down the market price.

One possibility is that the two companies will engage in **collusion**. Sellers engage in collusion when they cooperate to raise each others’ profits.

The strongest form of collusion is a **cartel**, an agreement by several producers to obey output restrictions to increase their joint profits.

They may also engage in **noncooperative behavior**, ignoring the effects of their actions on each others’ profits.

Firms may decide to engage in _quantity competition_ or _price competition_.

The basic insight of the quantity competition (or the Courno model) is that when firms are restricted in how much they can produce, it is easier for them to avoid excessive competition and to “divvy up” the market, thereby pricing above marginal cost and earning profits.

It is easier for them to achieve an outcome that looks like collusion without a formal agreement.

The logic behind the price competition (or the Bertrand model) is that when firms produce perfect substitutes and have sufficient capacity to satisfy demand when price is equal to marginal cost, then each firm will be compelled to engage in competition by undercutting its rival’s price until the price reaches marginal cost—that is, perfect competition.

The Prisoners' Dilemma

When the decisions of two or more firms significantly affect each others’ profits, they are in a situation of **interdependence**.

The study of behavior in situations of interdependence is known as **game theory**.

The reward received by a player in a game—such as the profit earned by an oligopolist—is that player’s **payoff**.

A **payoff matrix** shows how the payoff to each of the participants in a two-player game depends on the actions of both. Such a matrix helps us analyze interdependence.

When each firm has an incentive to cheat, but both are worse off if both cheat, the situation is known as a _prisoners’ dilemma_.

The game is based on two premises:

    1) Each player has an incentive to choose an action that benefits itself at the other player’s expense.
    2) When both players act in this way, both are worse off than if they had acted cooperatively.
    
An action is a **dominant strategy** when it is a player’s best action regardless of the action taken by the other player. Depending on the payoffs, a player may or may not have a dominant strategy.

A _Nash equilibrium_, also known as a **noncooperative equilibrium**, is the result when each player in a game chooses the action that maximizes his or her payoff given
the actions of other players, ignoring the effects of his or her action on the payoffs received by those other players.    

Players who don’t take their interdependence into account arrive at a Nash, or noncooperative, equilibrium.

But if a game is played repeatedly, players may engage in strategic behavior, sacrificing short-run profit to influence future behavior.

In repeated prisoners’ dilemma games, _tit for tat_ is often a good strategy, leading to successful _tacit collusion_.

**Tit for tat** involves playing cooperatively at first, then doing whatever the other player did in the previous period.

When firms limit production and raise prices in a way that raises each others’ profits, even though they have not made any formal agreement, they are engaged in **tacit collusion**.

An oligopolist who believes she will lose a substantial number of sales if she reduces output and increases her price, but will gain only a few additional sales if she increases output and lowers her price away from the tacit collusion outcome, faces a **kinked demand curve** — very flat above the kink and very steep below the kink.

It illustrates how tacit collusion can make an oligopolist unresponsive to changes in marginal cost within a certain range when those changes are unique to her.

Oligopolies operate under legal restrictions in the form of _antitrust policy_.

Antitrust policies are efforts undertaken by the government to prevent oligopolistic industries from becoming or behaving like monopolies.

Tacit collusion is limited by a number of factors, including:

    - large numbers of firms
    - complex products and pricing scheme
    - bargaining power of buyers
    - conflicts of interest among firms
    
When collusion breaks down, there is a _price war_.

To limit competition, oligopolists often engage in _product differentiation_, which is an attempt by a firm to convince buyers that its product is different from the products of other firms in the industry.

When products are differentiated, it is sometimes possible for an industry to achieve tacit collusion through _price leadership_.

Oligopolists often avoid competing directly on price, engaging in _nonprice competition_ through advertising and other means instead.    

In **price leadership**, one firm sets its price first, and other firms then follow.

Firms that have a tacit understanding not to compete on price often engage in intense **nonprice competition**, using advertising and other means to try to increase their sales.

# <a id="monopolistic-competition"></a>Monopolistic Competition

Monopolistic competition is a market structure in which
  - there are _many_ competing producers in an industry
  - each producer sells a _differentiated product_
  - there is _free entry into and exit from_ the industry in the long run

There are three important forms of product differentiation:

    1) Differentiation by style or type
    2) Differentiation by location
    3) Differentiation by quality
    
Whatever form it takes, however, there are two important features of industries with differentiated products:

**Competition among sellers:** Producers compete for the same market, so entry by more producers reduces the quantity each existing producer sells at any given price.

**Value in diversity:** In addition, consumers gain from the increased diversity of products.    

If the typical firm earns positive profits, new firms will enter the industry in the long run, shifting each existing firm’s demand curve to the left.

If the typical firm incurs losses, some existing firms will exit the industry in the long run, shifting the demand curve of each remaining firm to the right.

In the long run, equilibrium of a monopolistically competitive industry, the zero-profit-equilibrium, firms just break even.

The typical firm’s demand curve is just tangent to its average total cost curve at its profit-maximizing output.

In the long-run equilibrium of a monopolistically competitive industry, there are many firms, all earning zero profit.

Firms in a monopolistically competitive industry have _excess capacity_: they produce less than the output at which average total cost is minimized.

Price exceeds marginal cost, so some mutually beneficial trades are unexploited.

In industries with product differentiation, firms **advertise** to increase the demand for their products.

Some firms create _brand names_. A **brand name** is a name owned by a particular firm that distinguishes its products from those of other firms.

# <a id="externalities"></a>Externalities

The **marginal social cost of pollution** is the additional cost imposed on society as a whole by an additional unit of pollution.

The **marginal social benefit of pollution** is the additional gain to society as a whole from an additional unit of pollution.

The **socially optimal quantity of pollution** is the quantity of pollution that society would choose if all the costs and benefits of pollution were fully accounted for.

An **external cost** is an uncompensated cost that an individual or firm imposes on others.

An **external benefit** is a benefit that an individual or firm confers on others without receiving compensation.

Pollution is an example of an _external cost_, or _negative externality_; in contrast, some activities can give rise to external benefits, or positive externalities.

External costs and benefits are known as _externalities_.

In an influential 1960 article, the economist Ronald Coase pointed out that, in an ideal world, the private sector could indeed deal with all externalities.

According to the _Coase theorem_, even in the presence of externalities, an economy can always reach an efficient solution provided that the transaction costs—the costs to individuals of making a deal—are sufficiently low.

The costs of making a deal are known as **transaction costs**.

When individuals do take externalities into account, economists say that they _internalize the externality_.

**Environmental standards** are rules that protect the environment by specifying actions by producers and consumers. Generally such standards are inefficient because they are inflexible.

An **emissions tax** is a tax that depends on the amount of pollution a firm produces.

**Tradable emissions permits** are licenses to emit limited quantities of pollutants that can be bought and sold by polluters.

Taxes designed to reduce external costs are known as **Pigouvian taxes**.

When the quantity of pollution emitted can be directly observed and controlled, environmental goals can be achieved efficiently in two ways: emissions taxes and tradable emissions permits.

The **marginal social benefit of a good or activity** is equal to the marginal benefit that accrues to consumers, plus its marginal external benefit.

A **Pigouvian subsidy** is a payment designed to encourage activities that yield external benefits.

A **technology spillover** is an external benefit that results when knowledge spreads among individuals and firms. (The socially optimal quantity can be achieved by an optimal Pigouvian subsidy equal to the marginal external benefit.)

An **industrial policy** is a policy that supports industries believed to yield positive externalities.

The **marginal social cost of a good or activity** is equal to the marginal cost of production, plus its marginal external cost.

A good is subject to a **network externality** when the value of the good to an individual is greater when a large number of other people also use the good.

A good is subject to _positive feedback_ when success breeds greater success and failure breeds failure.

# <a id="public-goods-and-common-resources"></a>Public Goods and Common Resources

Goods can be classified according to two attributes:

    - whether they are excludable
    - whether they are rival in consumption
    
A good is **excludable** if the supplier of that good can prevent people who do not pay from consuming it.

A good is **rival in consumption** if the same unit of the good cannot be consumed by more than one person at the same time.

A good that is both excludable and rival in consumption is a _private good_.

When a good is _nonexcludable_, the supplier cannot prevent consumption by people who do not pay for it.

A good is _nonrival in consumption_ if more than one person can consume the same unit of the good at the same time.

There are four types of goods:

  - Private goods, which are excludable and rival in consumption, like wheat
  - Public goods, which are nonexcludable and nonrival in consumption, like a public sewer system
  - Common resources, which are nonexcludable but rival in consumption, like clean water in a river
  - Artificially scarce goods, which are excludable but nonrival in consumption, like pay-per-view movies on cable TV

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75806093/125163041-800d6f80-e18b-11eb-945e-cccf721e8b70.png)

Goods that are nonexcludable suffer from the **free-rider problem**: individuals have no incentive to pay for their own consumption and instead will take a “free ride” on anyone who does pay.

When goods are nonrival in consumption, the efficient price for consumption is zero.

A **public good** is the exact opposite of a private good: it is a good that is both nonexcludable and nonrival in consumption.

Governments engage in cost-benefit analysis when they estimate the social costs and social benefits of providing a public good.

A **common resource** is nonexcludable and rival in consumption: you can’t stop me from consuming the good, and more consumption by me means less of the good available for you.

Common resources left to the free market suffer from _overuse_.

**Overuse** occurs when a user depletes the amount of the common resource available to others but does not take this cost into account when deciding how much to use the common resource.

An **artificially scarce good** is excludable but nonrival in consumption.
